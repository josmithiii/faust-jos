History

This directory was created May 27 2013 from files in /l/pfjed =
/Users/jos/w/pure-jos/pd-faust/examples/dsp containing percussion
developed for Zelda Overworld in pd-faust.  The files were copied
rather than moved so that they may diverge without breaking the pfej
project.

Most of the patches at this point were ports of SuperCollider patches
(see comments in the files for pointers).
